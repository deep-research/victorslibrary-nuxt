  One time I spent an entire summer listening to [crossover thrash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_thrash). Things eventually boiled over when I repeatedly screamed “Al Qaeda” and gave the Nazi salute towards a busy intersection of commuters stuck in traffic. I was on rollerblades.

  This recording was also a lot of fun to make because I had scream "Al Qaeda" at the top of my lungs repeatedly.

lyrics: |
  The president’s a killer, wants to bleed you till you’re dead
  You voted for the f***ing war, but send kids in your stead
  The coward is so blinded, he can’t recognize your bribes
  They bought the f***ing system, now they’re telling you you’ll thrive
  There is no way in hell that they can save us with their lies
  Show the f***ing sheeple they are causing our demise

  Al Qaeda and Jesus
  Yeah

  There is no simple way to function in this freaking life
  The work and pain and suffering shall carve you like a knife
  Experience will shape your mind and body to be new
  Perspectives you must live by be the ethics you will choose
  Do you know the kind of souls that you will all become?
  The kindest now among us may obliterate the sun
  And worship darkest demons by the citadel of hate
  Encountering angelic souls that now must seal their fate

  I’ll tell you what to do, I know the way to save your life
  Take a f***ing magnum gun to shoot your boss and wife
  Your chakras and your astral body surely will be cleansed
  There is no time to wait ’cause you can never strike again
  All the people, all your life, have always made you slave
  Pay them back with countless sorrows empathy won’t name
  In anger and in fear all of the dark ones shall rejoice
  Before all of us go to hell, we’ll let them hear our voice

  Al Qaeda and Jesus
  Al Qaeda and Jesus Christ
