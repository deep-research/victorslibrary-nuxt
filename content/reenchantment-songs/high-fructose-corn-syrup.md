lyrics: |
  I left my home, went out the door
  I drove away into the cold
  There’s so many people here but I’m alone
  Life’s too fast and it got sold

  High Fructose Corn Syrup
  Nothing’s real anymore
  You wanted something to believe in
  But only lies are told

  By the banks where I was born
  There was a man who lived alone
  His house was washed away by the storm
  He called for help but he was alone, oh yeah

  High Fructose Corn Syrup
  Nothing’s real anymore
  You wanted something to believe in, but I know
  I know that only lies are told

  High Fructose Corn Syrup
  Nothing’s real anymore
  You wanted something to believe in, and I know
  I know that something’s gotta go
