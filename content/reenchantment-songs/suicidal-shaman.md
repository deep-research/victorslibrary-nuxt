lyrics: |
  I am unemployed
  I am f\*\*\*ing sick
  I still live with my parents
  And I don’t give a s\*\*\*

  I am single and lonely
  And I hate this f\*\*\*ing world
  I never thought it would be like this
  And I just can’t forget that girl
  
  Yeah

  I like Eric and Dylan
  ’cause you have raped my f\*\*\*ing soul
  I’m a slave in this hopeless trap
  The lowest ones are in control

  I know I have no future
  This evil system has to die
  Your brightest turn to darkness
  For you must pay for every lie
