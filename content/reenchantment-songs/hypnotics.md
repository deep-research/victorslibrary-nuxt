lyrics: |
  Screw this world
  It is lost
  Destroyed by hatred
  Trashed with mistrust

  Each man must fight
  On his own
  Without the law
  You are alone

  Ethereal forest
  Enchanted tomb
  Inside my basement
  In cryptic gloom

  Wither shall we wander
  Who will redeem
  After the doom
  Of human dream
