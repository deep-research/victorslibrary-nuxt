lyrics: |
  I wanna die, wanna go right to hell now
  The chains are in my brain there’s no hope for escape now
  I’ve lost my soul, I am blind, I am drowning
  The pain is all that’s real, it’s the only thing I can feel

  I don’t care, don’t understand, how life has brought me here
  This pain’s not who I am dissolving into fear
  Gun down all the people, so we can show them he’s real
  Shout down to the lord, he rules you all with his despair

  I don’t care, don’t understand, how life has brought me here
  This pain’s not who I am dissolving into fear
  Gun down all the people, so we can show them he’s real
  Bow down to the lord, he rules you all with his despair
