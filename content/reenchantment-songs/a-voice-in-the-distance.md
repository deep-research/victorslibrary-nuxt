lyrics: |
  It’s been a hard time
  From many years ago
  We’ve lost so much we had
  And hope is hard to show

  I cared about you all
  But my distance feels so great
  I’ll pray to the gods above
  That the hour is not too late

  It’s such a heavy burden
  Living with a soul
  It’s hard to face the truth within
  A self beyond control

  Changing is the finest of
  the arts we have today
  No matter what the lies
  within me have to say

  A voice in the distance
  A voice within
  A voice that is calling
  For you to not give in
