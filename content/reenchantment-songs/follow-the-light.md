lyrics: |
  All my life, I follow the light
  Hoping it will lead somewhere
  But sometimes it seems that I have no chance
  ‘cause everyone is there to hold me back

  Don’t believe in anything
  Religion is just a lie
  Everyone wants something from me
  But I can only be myself

  I don't want your money
  I don't want any fame
  Your values are worthless
  And filled with shame

  What have you done
  Everything is ruined
  It is the end
  Of all time

  I will suffer
  For eternity
  The pain's never ending
  Satan laughs at me
