lyrics: |
  Mad in time
  Wasn’t right
  Right in line
  But thinking fine

  Thinking fine
  Dying divine
  Mad in time
  But thinking fine

  Magic sigh
  Nothing’s mine
  Drinking wine
  A witches bride

  Thinking fine
  Dying divine
  Mad in time
  But thinking fine

  Slowing time
  So far behind
  Friends in mind
  But then it’s a lie

  Thinking fine
  Dying divine
  Mad in time
  But thinking fine
