lyrics: |
  The sun is shining
  There is nothing to fear
  Green grass is growing
  Wild forests are near

  The secrets of nature
  Expand my mind
  And all the haters
  They must be blind

  They’re blind

  Together, forever
  We’ll live in peace
  Just never, surrender
  No one to please

  We’ll fight for freedom
  To save our world
  Unlock the future
  For every boy and girl

  It’s just propaganda
  All that they teach here
  Trying to convince you
  To live in fear
  In fear
