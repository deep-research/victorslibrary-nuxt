lyrics: |
  I cannot continue on without you
  Though I many not even know, who you are
  The void forms in an empty place, through the heart
  And I can’t even start to tell you how it feels

  I were lost so far away, looking through the dark
  That which unspeakable, may not be found
  I’ll wonder anyway, for you and me
  Someday I pray that you will see
  And one day I pray that you will be there with me
