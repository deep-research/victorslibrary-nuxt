## Areas of Interest

### [Meditation](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/773695994)

Meditation is an introspective practice where you follow your thought process. You can use it to expand your awareness of your subconscious mind.

### [Hypnosis](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1066694401)

Hypnosis differs from meditation bin that you actually alter your thoughts. You can use it to influence your subconscious mind.

As Lao Tzu wrote:
> Watch your thoughts, they become your words;
> watch your words, they become your actions;
> watch your actions, they become your habits;
> watch your habits, they become your character;
> watch your character, it becomes your destiny.

Meditation and hypnosis both work primarily through a person's internal monologue.

### Ritual

Meditation and hypnosis can also be practiced along with various art forms. Every medium is able to access or impact a different part of the psyche.

A key aspect to remember is that symbolic actions have an emotional effect on people. Correspondences are studied in the occult to understand this symbolism.

### Art

Art is the practice of creating powerful objects with the purpose of reenchanting the world. This is possible because physical objects can be empowered with messages from the subconscious mind.

Works of fiction such as myths, fairy tales and fantasy novels describe the nature of these subconscious forces.

### Divination

Divination is very similar to art. You use your feelings to intuitively gather information.

By practicing divination, you can access information that lies within your psyche. The limits of the psyche are not well understood.

### Omens

Omens are events that are impacted by metaphysical forces. You can definitely feel it when you're in the presence of something of this nature.

Jungian psychology, parapsychology and transpersonal psychology are fields that study the nature of psychic ability.

### Infinity

The study of infinity leads to very interesting philosophical insights. It can be explored with infinite mirrors and [randomization](https://www.random.org/) techniques. Some randomization techniques include randomized behavior patterns and abstract art.

It is worth noting that a computer cannot calculate infinity. Infinite values can only be approached with an asymptote.

An infinite mind would be the equivalent of god as described by the monotheistic traditions.

### Entheogens

These powerful substances have been considered a window into a higher realm throughout history.

Research on the topic has been expanding in recent years.

### [Astrology](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/954128880)

Astrologers study the influence of celestial forces on human life.

I would recommend Osho's book "Astrology: Superstition, Blind Faith or a Door to the Essential?" as well as the writings of Michel Gauquelin for a science-based approach.

### [Lucid Dreaming](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/993816515)

Lucid dreaming is an unusual state of mind with very interesting properties. Lucid dreams definitely give you the impression that you are in another world.

Carlos Castaneda:
> A man goes to knowledge as he goes to war: wide-awake, with fear, with respect, and with absolute assurance. Going to knowledge or going to war in any other manner is a mistake, and whoever makes it might never live to regret it.
