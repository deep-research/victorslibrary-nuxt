  I was required to play public service announcements on Reverend Radio, which was my college radio show. After getting sick of them, I decided to make one of my own. It ended up playing the automation system for months.

  Hello, I’m The Reverend of Despair and you’re listening to WMXM 88.9 FM, Lake Forest College Radio

  Spring is just around the corner so get outside, have a breath of fresh air, put on some Rollerblades

  You’ll have a great time, I promise

  I mean what else are you gonna do, be on your computer all day?

  Take a break from studying, and just enjoy the nice weather

  *This has been a public service announcement from The Reverend of Despair*
