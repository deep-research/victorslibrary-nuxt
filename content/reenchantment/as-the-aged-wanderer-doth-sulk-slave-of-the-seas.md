lyrics: |
  A storm approaches, the clouds are darkened, black castles reign the sky
  The hour is nearing, all we were fearing, don’t be afraid to die
  Nothing familiar, is here for comfort, night and shade collide
  Cold thorns are bleeding, me from the inside, how did I lose my life

  Where have we gone now, so far away from, all that I ever tried
  To hold together, our bond forever

  Yeah

  And I beg the heavens for solace
  I cry and weep and pray, heal me

  What have I done to deserve this fate
