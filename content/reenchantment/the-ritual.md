lyrics: |
  Into dark, I was born
  No redemption from the cold
  All alone, I walk the earth
  Never to feel pleasure again

  Through all time to the dawn of man
  Where is fate leading us to
  I cannot see through vast eternity
  But I know we can’t abandon hope

  Through the ages, man has fought
  We use weapons to destroy ourselves
  In troubled times, we don’t concern
  Ourselves with others’ suffering

  It’s a crime to think that cruelty
  Towards a brother is so small a thing
  Though we all worship different gods
  We dwell beneath the same sky

  Save me from myself
  I’ve have enough of this
