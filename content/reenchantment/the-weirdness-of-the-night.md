lyrics: |
  The weirdness of the night destroys all the peace inside the mind
  The fearless must go on without the sun

  We’ve lost our deepest selves to the voices of the piper
  I hope you understand that you’ll never come back to home

  We’ve gone so far beyond any dreams we could imagine
  I hope you understand that we’ll never come back to home
