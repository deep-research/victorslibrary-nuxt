lyrics: |
  Hey darlin’ where’d you leave, and why so far away?
  And don’t you realize that I’m beggin’ for you here to stay?
  I know you’ll find what you seek, ya don’t even have to go
  There’s no need to take a single step, I’ll show you by another road

  That afternoon like fog, and almost time to grieve
  One last farewell, hide the tears, and I could barely breathe
  So thanks for all those memories, the beauty’s fadin’ fast
  And if you could feel my pain, you’d see that I won’t last
