### 2006

-   I started playing guitar after I discovered 60s psychedelic rock bands like The Beatles, Queen, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Steppenwolf, Creedence, Rare Earth and Jefferson Airplane.
-   I had previously been a violin player in school orchestras with an interest in folk music, disco music and movie soundtracks.

### 2007

-   After getting into Slayer, Melechesh and Amon Amarth, I was inspired to discover what the heaviest possible music is. This lead to an intense interest in doom metal and black metal.
-   I starting writing a doom metal and psychedelic rock live set.
-   David and I participated in a short lived rock band called *Lamp*.
-   I started a band called *[Shroud of Delirium](https://strangepeopleinpain.bandcamp.com/album/the-former-shroud-of-delirium)* with David on drums. Aaron became the bassist shortly afterwards by playing a middle eastern sounding scale that seemed very impressive at the time.
-   Our band was mostly playing doom metal songs with a black metal influence such as Follow the Light, The Ritual, and Hypnotics.
-   We played live at a hookah bar called *Swingstate* that is no longer in existence.

### 2008

-   The band entered a psychedelic period in 2008.
-   I was into stoner movies like *Dig!*, *Dazed & Confused* and *This Is How We Trip* at the time. I also loved conspiracy documentaries on *Google Video* like *Zeitgeist* and *America: Freedom to Fascism*.
-   I added Acoustic rock songs such as They'll Come For You and Remember to the set.
-   A short lived project called *Jeff's After School Special* was formed.

### 2009

-   We radically slowed down our tempos due to an increased interest in funeral doom and drone doom.
-   We also became interested in spiritual practices such as meditation and ritual.

### 2010

-   Aaron visited a spiritual community in New Mexico called the *[Lama Foundation](https://www.lamafoundation.org/)* and eventually became their treasurer.
-   Due to the fact that the band was starting to wane, I started a solo project called *The Reverend of Despair.*
-   I also started a radio show called *[Reverend Radio](https://strangepeopleinpain.bandcamp.com/album/the-reverend-radio-promos)* on [WMXM 88.9 FM](http://wmxm.org/), Lake Forest College radio.

### 2011

-   I became increasingly interested in the occult.
-   I recorded an eclectic album called *[Spirit Writing](https://strangepeopleinpain.bandcamp.com/album/spirit-writing)*. It had a pleasantly underground feel to it.

### 2012

-   I recorded an album called *[At the Edge of the World](https://strangepeopleinpain.bandcamp.com/album/at-the-edge-of-the-world)* that had a much bigger sound.

Here is a quote that was used to spread the malevolent influence of the album:
> We, His Excellency The Lord Reverend Wizard of Alchemical Despair Himself! By the Grace of God, Emperor and Autocrat of All Underground Heavy Metal and Rock and Roll Music and the Most Feared D.J. on All Radio, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera Hereby Pronounce "At the Edge of the World" to be the Greatest Recording Ever Created For All Time With No Exception and Deem It Mandatory to Listen to This Record, For All Able Bodied Souls Within the Confines of The Reverend's Magnificently Glorious and Eternal Empire.

### 2013

-   Aaron also started a solo project called *[Pater Shrouder](https://patershrouder.bandcamp.com/)*.
-   Aaron and I completed a powerful and violent ritual known as *The Night of Nine Rites*.

### 2014

-   Aaron and I collaborated on a strange an awesome project known as *[The 666 Names of Aleister Crowley](https://patershrouder.bandcamp.com/track/666-names-of-aleister-crowley-demos)*.

### 2015

-   I graduated from Lake Forest College with a degree in music and religion.

### 2016

-   I created controversial website that covered news about witchcraft from around the world.
-   The site started to generate minor traffic from across the world.
-   I shut it down after it started getting attention from our friends in Virginia.
-   Aaron and I were also involved with a mysterious occult group known as *The Shadow Work Society*.

### 2017

-   I created yet another website called *The Deep Research Archive*. This was a close precursor to the current incarnation.

### 2018

-   I created the first version of this website to promote my music and archive all of my work.
-   I was studying in web development at the time, so the quality ended up being much higher than my previous attempts at publishing had been.
-   The recording quality for my music was also radically improving with recordings like They'll Come For You, The Ritual, The Ceremony of Forgiveness, and Otherworldly Dream Magic.
-   I debated whether my musical project should be called *Strange People in Pain* or *Reenchantment*.

### 2019

-   I became interested in library science to improve the research side of this project.
- I did a lot of writing and recording for the website. The main goal was to release demo versions of almost every song.

### 2020

- I created a second version of the website with a more developer friendly framework. It was definitely more custom, although I wasn't able to continue the process due to problems with the architecture.
- I started to work on recording demos to copyright my songs.

### 2021

- I completed a major update of my musical equipment.
- I was able to finish copyrighting my songs.
- I started to work on a third version of my website with a higher quality framework.
